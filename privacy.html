This Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes how personal information is handled by Lexicon ("Application"), an offline flashcards application designed for students, owned and operated by Ayaan Grover ("Developer", "we", "us", or "our"). By using the Application, you agree to the collection, use, and disclosure of your information as described in this Policy.

1. Information We Do Not Collect
Lexicon is an entirely offline application. As such, the Application does not collect, transmit, or store any personal or sensitive user data, including but not limited to:

Name, email address, or contact information

Device identifiers or IP addresses

Location data

Usage analytics or behavioral data

Flashcard content or study history

All user-generated content remains stored solely on the user’s local device and is never transmitted to the Developer or any third party.

2. Local Data Storage
All data created through the Application, including flashcards, decks, study logs, and related content, is stored exclusively on the user’s device. The Developer does not have access to this data and does not back it up on any remote server. Users are solely responsible for the management and security of their local data.

3. Third-Party Services
Lexicon does not incorporate or interact with any third-party services, SDKs, or APIs that collect user data. The Application is free of advertising, analytics, cloud services, or social media integration.

4. Children’s Privacy
Lexicon is suitable for users of all ages and does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. As no data is collected, the Application is in full compliance with applicable privacy laws, including the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

5. User-Controlled Backups
Users may optionally export or back up their data through their own means (e.g., file sharing, cloud storage, or physical transfer). These actions are initiated and controlled solely by the user. The Developer assumes no responsibility for the storage or protection of exported user data.

6. Data Security
As no data is collected or transmitted, Lexicon has no data transmission infrastructure requiring security protocols. Users are advised to utilize appropriate device-level security measures (e.g., encryption, password protection) to protect their data.

7. Policy Updates
This Privacy Policy may be amended periodically. Any changes will be reflected by the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document. Users are encouraged to review this Policy from time to time to stay informed of any modifications.
